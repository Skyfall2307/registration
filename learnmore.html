    <h1>About the Mentoring Program</h1>
<p>
  This mentoring program is created for <strong>Women in Procurement in Finland</strong> to foster connection, growth, and community support. Whether you're early in your career or an experienced professional, this is an opportunity to learn, share, and elevate each other in a supportive network.
</p>

<p>
  The program is <strong>free of charge</strong> and based entirely on <strong>willing participation</strong>. You can join as a <strong>mentor</strong>, a <strong>mentee</strong>, or as someone who’s <strong>open to either role</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  We will <strong>kick off in August 2025</strong> with a virtual introduction meeting to welcome everyone and set the tone for the experience. From there, mentor-mentee pairs will be encouraged to connect <strong>once per month</strong> for a dedicated 1:1 session.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to the personal mentorship journey, we’ll also come together as a full group <strong>once per quarter</strong> in virtual team sessions, or in person to share insights, reflect, and build our network as a community.
</p>

<p>
  Participation is entirely <strong>voluntary</strong>, with flexibility built in to accommodate each person's availability and goals. We're excited to welcome you!
